# ToDoList

## Description
Welcome to my version of ToDoList app. This is my first project. I use Java with MySQL database. Frontend designed on SWING, AWT. 
<br/> All your tasks have three statuses:
 <br/> 1. New <br/> 2. Done <br/> 3. Closed <br/> All tasks and their statuses saved in database and if you restart the app, all tasks will be available again. When task is closed
it will be deleted from list, but stored in database.
